### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dom and I'm a software architect and fullstack engineer experienced with the following frameworks, languages and technologies:

- Dart
- Typescript
- Flutter
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Postgres
- Dgraph

I'm also an entrepreneur and founder, and I'm currently building SaaS businesses and Flutter ecosystem design tools with my company Startcommerce.

I'm an ex-soldier in Electronic Warfare with the Signal Corps in the Australian Army.

I have past experience in many languages including .NET, Java, Ruby, Objective C, C++, Fortran to name a few and have a degree in Electronics Engineering.

I'm currently interested in e-commerce, e-governance, open banking, decentralized finance and blockchain.

I travel a lot with my family and work from home, wherever that is at the time.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have something you'd like to collaborate on.
